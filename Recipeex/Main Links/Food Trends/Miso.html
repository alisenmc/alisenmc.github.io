	<p>Miso is a Japanese paste made by fermenting soybeans with salt, the fungus k≈çji, and occasionally rice, barley, and 
	water. It is regarded as the most popular Japanese condiment and seasoning, commonly used to flavor soups, stews, sauces,
	spreads, and salad dressings.
	<br>
	<br>
	There are numerous miso varieties which differ in the length of the fermenting process and ingredients, resulting in 
	different flavor of the products. The three basic types include the rice-based miso, referred to as kome, the barley miso,
	known as mugi, and the soybean mame miso.
	<br>
	<br>
	Other types include the mixed variety chougou, the long matured akamiso, and the famous shiromiso, which is white in color
	and also the most popular variety consumed in Japan. Although today it is traditionally associated with Japan, miso is 
	believed to have Korean or Chinese origins.
	<br>
	<br>
	Some historians believe that the predecessor of miso was jiang, a traditional Chinese fermented paste which was brought to 
	Japan in the 6th century. It was renamed as miso and soon became the Japanese favorite. The whole development process was 
	somewhat unfamiliar to the Japanese until the arrival of European scholars.
	<br>
	<br>
	They were the ones who studied the process of production, the ingredients, and the social importance of miso. Initially,
	miso was consumed by the lower classes and was especially popular in the Northeast, where each family produced their miso
	paste.
	<br>
	<br>
	Up until the mid-20th century, miso rose in popularity and was commercially produced by numerous factories. However, due to
	government actions and the effects of the Second World War, its importance diminished for a shorter period, but only to 
	continue its growth after the 1980s, when it became an internationally recognized product, especially favored in Singapore,
	United States, and the Netherlands.
	<br>
	<br>
	For the Japanese, the production of miso is an art form, and it is treated as one of the most important Japanese products.
	Although it is used in sauces, simmered dishes, and as a tofu topping, the most famous dish incorporating this flavorful
	condiment is the authentic Japanese miso soup.
