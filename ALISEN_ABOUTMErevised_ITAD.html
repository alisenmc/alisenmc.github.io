<h2>Childhood Years</h2>

<h3><blockquote><q>Summer will end soon enough, and childhood as well.</q></blockquote></h3>
― <cite>George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones</cite>

<br>
<br>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in the old days, me and my sister loves playing outside.<sup>1</sup> 
We always make alternative toys using anything we found in our backyard.<sup>2</sup> I remembered playing <i><em>luto-lutoan</em></i> and <em><i>bahay-bahayan</i></em> with her.<sup>3</sup> 
We we’re inseparable because we only have each other.<sup>4</sup>  We always argue about small things but in the end of the day we reconcile.<sup>5</sup>  
Between the two of us she’s tougher than me.<sup>6</sup> I always cry over small things.<sup>7</sup> 
They said that I’m the soft hearted one compared to her.<sup>8</sup> I’m super clingy, I love hugging people around and I’m super obsessed with cute stuffs.<sup>9</sup> 
In the past, we had our first dog named Cute.<sup>10</sup> She’s very fluffy and she looks like a white teddy bear.<sup>11</sup> 
My grandfather said that the puppy followed him when he’s on his way to our home.<sup>12</sup> No one claimed him that’s why we adopted the puppy and named him Cute.<sup>13</sup> 
Cute became our sunshine.<sup>14</sup> We love cuddling with her but sadly she died due to an accident.<sup>15</sup> 
That incident made me realize that I can’t have the things or persons I love with me forever.<sup>16</sup> They say that childhood is the light of our life and we must keep it safe within our hearts.<sup>17</sup> 
I can say that I had an astonishing childhood.<sup>18</sup> But like the summer, childhood ends soon without me noticing it.<sup>19</sup> 
If I’ll be given a chance, I would love to become a child again to be able to feel free without worrying what might happen in the next coming days.<sup>20</sup>

<h2>Teenage Years</h2>

<h3><blockquote><q>It takes courage to grow up and become who you really are.</q></blockquote></h3>
― <cite>e. e. cummings</cite>

<br>
<br>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I grow older, I had a lot of realization.<sup>1</sup> My teenage year wasn't easy.<sup>2</sup>
 This is the time where I became more insecure.<sup>3</sup> I feel like expectations robbed my happiness.<sup>4</sup> 
 People always compare me with my sister and I hated it.<sup>5</sup> I  slowly lost interest in things and began living up to their expectations.<sup>6</sup> I did my best to make my parents proud of me.<sup>7</sup> 
 But then I realized that I’m not happy with what I’m doing.<sup>8</sup> Darker days come and I don’t know what to do anymore.<sup>9</sup> 
 One of my teacher in junior high school encouraged me to join in the cell group.<sup>10</sup> At first I hesitated because I’m not a Christian and I don’t know what cell groups do but I still joined it.<sup>11</sup> 
 I think that it was a blessing in disguise to be a part of that cell group.<sup>12</sup> The cell group made me surrender my worries and hatred.<sup>13</sup> It served as a light for me to find who really I am.<sup>14</sup> 
 I had the courage to live not for others but live for myself.<sup>15</sup> I slowly began to accept myself.<sup>16</sup> I always make sure that every time I feel bad, I pray hard and do my best to be positive.<sup>17</sup> 
 It always takes courage to become who you really are.<sup>18</sup> I thank God that he made me strong enough to be able to fight my own battle.<sup>19</sup> 
 Life’s really tough and I’m not even in the half of it yet but my experience made me who I am now and I want to continue to enjoy every moment of my life.<sup>20</sup>

<h2>College Years</h2>

<h3><blockquote><q>Take it all one day at a time and enjoy the journey.</q></blockquote></h3> — <cite>Kristi Barlett</cite>

<br>
<br>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me college is the scariest yet challenging part of my life.<sup>1</sup> I remembered when I first entered in UE I feel lost and alone.<sup>2</sup> 
I’m a shy type of person and I don’t talk too much.<sup>3</sup> I thought that I will have a lonely college life but I was wrong.<sup>4</sup> 
IT wasn’t really my choice that’s why I had a hard time back then.<sup>5</sup> But because I met amazing people that became my cheerleader I was able to enjoy even if I’m having a hard time.<sup>6</sup> 
Me and my friends doubted ourselves because we feel like we don’t belong here.<sup>7</sup> But as time goes time we are somehow able to feel positive.<sup>8</sup> 
We still have a lot of worries but as long as we’re together we do believe that we can make it.<sup>9</sup> I was enjoying my first year days but then a pandemic happened.<sup>10</sup> 
I felt sad and I really miss hanging out with my friends.<sup>11</sup> Because of Covid-19 we are not able to enjoy our sophomore year.<sup>12</sup> We have friends who weren’t able to enroll this school year.<sup>13</sup> 
We won’t be able to fulfill our promise that we will all graduate on time and it makes me feel sad.<sup>14</sup> How I wish Covid never happened.<sup>15</sup> 
I always pray that this pandemic ends soon.<sup>16</sup> We aren’t taking an easy path but it doesn’t end our journey here.<sup>17</sup> We may feel tired but we will never give up.<sup>18</sup> Soon, I do believe that we will achieve our dreams.<sup>19</sup> 
I want to enjoy every moment I have because I’m not getting any younger anymore.<sup>20</sup>
